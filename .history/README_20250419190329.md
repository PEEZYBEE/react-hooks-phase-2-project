# 🍽️ Menu Manager

**Menu Manager** is a full-stack CRUD application that allows restaurant staff to manage dishes on a digital menu. Users can add new dishes, edit existing ones, mark them as available/unavailable, and delete them. The frontend is built with **React (Vite)** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend is powered by **json-server**, deployed on **Render**.

## 👩🏽‍💻 Guide for Beginners

### Understanding the Frontend

1. **Entry Point – `main.jsx`**
   - Starts the React app and renders `App.jsx`.

2. **Routing – `App.jsx`**
   - Uses React Router to define page routes:
     - `/` → MenuPage
     - `/add` → AddDishPage
     - `/edit/:id` → EditDishPage

3. **UI Components – `src/components/`**
   - `Header.jsx`: Top bar for navigation.
   - `DishCard.jsx`: Displays each dish with edit/delete/toggle buttons.
   - `DishForm.jsx`: Used on both Add and Edit pages to handle user inputs.

4. **Pages – `src/pages/`**
   - `MenuPage.jsx`: Shows all dishes by fetching them from the backend.
   - `AddDishPage.jsx`: Uses `DishForm` to submit new dishes.
   - `EditDishPage.jsx`: Loads dish data into the form and updates it via PATCH.

5. **Styling – Tailwind CSS**
   - All components are styled using Tailwind utility classes directly in the JSX.

6. **Feedback & Alerts**
   - Toastify is used for success messages.
   - SweetAlert is used for confirmation popups (like when deleting a dish).

### Understanding the Backend

1. **Backend Folder – `menu-manager-backend/`**
   - Contains a simple `json-server` setup for fake API endpoints.

2. **`db.json`**
   - This is your mock database. It stores all the dishes as JSON objects.

3. **`server.js`**
   - Custom configuration for running json-server with middleware like CORS.

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd menu-manager-backend
   npm install
   npm start
📡 API Endpoints
